# Periodic auto-update on Zsh startup: 'ask' or 'no'.
# You can manually run `z4h update` to update everything.
zstyle ':z4h:' auto-update      'ask'
# Ask whether to auto-update this often; has no effect if auto-update is 'no'.
zstyle ':z4h:' auto-update-days '28'

# Move prompt to the bottom when zsh starts and on Ctrl+L.
zstyle ':z4h:' prompt-at-bottom 'yes'

# Keyboard type: 'mac' or 'pc'.
zstyle ':z4h:bindkey' keyboard  'pc'

# Mark up shell's output with semantic information.
zstyle ':z4h:' term-shell-integration 'yes'

# Right-arrow key accepts one character ('partial-accept') from
# command autosuggestions or the whole thing ('accept')?
zstyle ':z4h:autosuggestions' forward-char 'accept'

# Recursively traverse directories when TAB-completing files.
zstyle ':z4h:fzf-complete' recurse-dirs 'yes'

# Clone additional Git repositories from GitHub.

# This doesn't do anything apart from cloning the repository and keeping it
# up-to-date. Cloned files can be used after `z4h init`. This is just an
# example. If you don't plan to use Oh My Zsh, delete this line.

# Install or update core components (fzf, zsh-autosuggestions, etc.) and
# initialize Zsh. After this point console I/O is unavailable until Zsh
# is fully initialized. Everything that requires user interaction or can
# perform network I/O must be done above. Everything else is best done below.
